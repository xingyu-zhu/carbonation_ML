# Introduction
The project focuses on explainable machine learning methods to predict the CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration values in carbonation and analyze the impact of input features on CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rate. Models were developed based on [scikit-learn version 1.2.0](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [SHAP version 0.41.0](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#).
